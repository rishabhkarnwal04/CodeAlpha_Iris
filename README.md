# Iris Flower Classification - CodeAlpha Internship Task

This project was completed as part of the Data Science Internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## Task Objective

Build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Task Requirements (from CodeAlpha)
- Use Iris flower measurements as input features.
- Train a classification model to predict flower species.
- Use Scikit-learn for preprocessing and modeling.
- Evaluate the model’s performance on test data.
- Understand basic ML classification concepts.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ML Models Used
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)

## Results
All models achieved high accuracy. Visualizations (pairplots, heatmaps) helped confirm class separation.

## Dataset
Iris.csv — Provided manually (original from UCI or Kaggle)
